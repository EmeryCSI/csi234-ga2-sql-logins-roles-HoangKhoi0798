1. Types of Permissions Assigned
SELECT: Allow user to read or query data from a table or view. The most basic level of access.
INSERT: Allows a user to add new rows of data into a table.
UPDATE: Enables a user to modify existing data within a table.
DELETE: Permits a user to remove rows of data from a table.


2. Schema-Level vs. Table-Level Permissions
Schema-Level Permissions: When you grant permissions on a SCHEMA (GA1), 
the user automatically inherits permissions for current
and later objects in that schema.

Table-Level Permissions: Apply only to a specific table.
Used when a user needs access to one specific dataset but shoud not be allowed in anything else.


3. Column-Level Permissions
How they work: Allows administrator to grant or deny access to specific columns in a table.

Why they are useful: They protect sensitive data while still allow users to do their jobs
with parts that are not sensitive.


4. The Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)
The Principle of Least Privilege states that a user should be given the minimum
access or permissions needed to perform their job.

Application:

The "SalesRepUser" was given SELECT but denied Salary,
because their job doesn't require knowing payroll.

The ITSupportUser can update names and departments for maintenance
but is blocked from changing salaries to prevent financial fraud.


5. Security Benefits of Using Roles

For exmple, if 10 new HR employees are hired, you can add them to the HRRole
without having to give permission to each one. It also ensures that every person in a specific job
has the same permissions, without missing or going over usual permission. You can also check out what
an entire group can do easier than going through each and every single person at a time.
